{"input": "What is LSD", "output": "Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) is a new type of crypto asset that offers traders the opportunity to benefit from the rewards of staking without actually holding the underlying token."}
{"input": "Why LSD is Important", "output": "The crypto industry is constantly evolving, and Liquid Staking Derivatives represent a new and innovative way for traders to participate in the crypto space. By allowing traders to stake but not necessarily holding the token,, LSDs offer a flexible and convenient way for traders to benefit from the rewards of staking."}
{"input": "Benefits of LSD", "output": "Increased liquidity: LSD allows investors to earn rewards from staking activities without having to lock up their assets for a long period of time. This increased liquidity can provide traders with more flexibility and opportunities to trade and earn rewards.\nHigher returns: LSD can provide higher returns compared to traditional staking methods as the rewards are based on the price movements of the underlying assets in the liquidity pool. This means that traders can earn rewards not only from staking, but also from the appreciation of the assets in the pool."}
{"input": "What staking options are available in  NodeDAO?", "output": "You can choose between pooling any amount of ETH together with other stakers in NodeDAO Pool and launching individual validators with blocks of 32 ETH.\n\n"}
{"input": "Is NodeDAO Safe to use ?\n", "output": "At NodeDAO, we take every necessary precaution, including undergoing code audits, to ensure the safety of our platform. However, we still encourage users to conduct their own due diligence (DYODD) before making any deposits."}
{"input": "How does NodeDAO minimise risk of slashing and penalties?\n", "output": "When taking a look at our deposit and withdrawal formulas, you will notice that slashing and penalties will affect across ALL operator pools. As a result, a minimum deposit requirement of 1.1 ETH or the applicable rate, whichever is higher, when joining as an operator. Upon slashing or penalties faced by an individual operator, the deposit of the responsible operator will be deducted to cover the loss. The penalty will be decided by a round of voting by the DAO. And only upon meeting the required minimum deposit will they be allowed to withdraw rewards."}
{"input": "Why choose NodeDAO?\n", "output": "Maximizing Yield Pool Solution - Built on a secure foundation, our Pool solution charges competitive fees and tokenises deposits and rewards to optimise staking returns for users. If you prioritize yield, liquidity of your stake, and access to profit-maximizing opportunities in DeFi, this Pool is for you. \n\nEstablished Track Record - With the founding organisations having deep experience in handling various blockchain projects, and with decentralising the Ethereum staking network in mind, NodeDAO has gone above and beyond to stress-test and perfect our system. \n\n"}
{"input": "How does NodeDAO Pool work?\n", "output": "NodeDAO operates a network of validators through its Pool offering. For each group of 32 ETH deposit made by users, NodeDAO will establish a new validator and integrate it into the network. The rewards generated from these validators are distributed among the users in proportion to their ETH contribution to the Pool."}

{"input": "How can I track the amount of my staking rewards in NodeDAO Pool?\n", "output": "You may track them from the individual operator's platform.\n\n"}
{"input": "How can I withdraw my deposit and rewards from NodeDAO Pool?\n", "output": "Pre-Shanghai upgrade, stakers will find nETH liquidity in the open market. The price of the nETH will be determined by the demand of the stakers buying the nETH corresponding to the price and earning ratio in the open market and the operators whom may take advantage of abitrage opportunities to lower their stakes in the liquidity pool.\n\nPost-Shanghai upgrade, NodeDAO users will be able to exchange their nETH tokens for ETH at a rate proportion to the supply of ETH and nETH directly within the platform."}
{"input": "Is NodeDAO non-custodial? \n", "output": "The funds are locked in the Ethereum network, withdrawals are implemented by the liquidstaking contract, governed by the DAO."}

{"input": "What happens if I transfer/exchange my nETH token?\n", "output": "When you exchange or transfer your nETH tokens, which represent your rewards in the NodeDAO pool, you are essentially transferring your rewards to someone else. This is not a problem and we encourage it as it allows you to make another ETH deposit and grow your returns through compounding."}

{"input": "What is the maximum amount that can be transferred in a leveraged transaction?", "output": "When transferring from a margin account, it is necessary to ensure that the risk rate after the transfer is not less than 200%, and the part exceeding 200% can be transferred out of the margin account."}
{"input": "How to calculate interest in a leveraged transaction?", "output": "Interest is calculated at 0:00 every day, and interest = outstanding loan assets × daily interest rate × loan days (charged by day, less than 1 day will be calculated as 1 day).

{"input": "What is ETF trading?", "output": "ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a very popular financial derivative in the traditional financial market. It is a trading product that tracks the multiples of the rise and fall of the target asset (such as BTC) and has leveraged attributes.\nChainUp ETF products, similar to huobi's ETP (Exchange Traded Products) products.\n\nThe currency in the name of the ETF product represents the underlying asset being tracked, and the numbers represent the direction and multiples of long and short positions, for example:\nBTC 3x long product, its English name is BTC 3X Long, abbreviated as BTC3L;\nBTC 3 times bearish product, its English name is BTC 3X Short, abbreviated as BTC3S;\nFor every 1% increase in BTC, the net value of BTC3L increases by 3%, and the net value of BTC3S decreases by 3%.\nThe bottom layer of ChainUp ETF products is connected with futures transactions, ensuring that when users trade ETFs, there are corresponding contract positions at the bottom layer, which can hedge exchange risks and redeem users' profits. For example, if a user buys 1 share of BTC3L/USDT, the system needs to open a corresponding long position of 1 share of BTCUSDT 3 times. Therefore, ETF currency pairs need the support of liquidity market making. Before opening ETF currency pairs, it is necessary to connect with liquidity in advance.\nETF leverage can be adjusted arbitrarily. The current liquidity environment supports a maximum leverage of 20 times.\n\n\n"}

{"input": "What does it mean to Use the original BTC in grid trading?", "output": "The BTC here refers to the base currency of the coin pair. You can choose to invest in single or dual crypto.Different strategies require different funds for each grid.
